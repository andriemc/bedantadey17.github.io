    <h1>I hate Google now. Here's why.</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>This is nothing short of a rant post. So, if you aren't patient enough to dig through and read countless amounts of dissing towards Google, or are just a Google defender, this post is not for you.<br><br>

        I have been using Google for all of my life now. Not just the search engine, but everything in their ecosystem. Everything just ties in so nicely with each other, and as a owner of an Android phone, everything is just Google-ified beautifully. I have seen many people diss on Google, saying it's just another corporate giant and that it will take over the world one day, but I felt differently. Not for Google, but with this whole corporate ideology. I still believe, if something is free, you are the product. And the tech world is filled with corporations. The open-source community is still a few distance apart from reaching that level of connectivity and sense-of-efficiency that most corporate companies like Google and Microsoft offer.<br><br>

        Needless to say, I was a Google fanboy. But something happened. Things kept changing. The company got better, but greedier and needier. I am sure you all have used Google Play, and you know that in order to make payments through Google Play you can use play balance or any other payment instrument. I used play balance for nearly everything, icon packs, productivity apps, etc. It was flawless and smooth. But what happened one day, is very weird.<br><br>
        
        "Your transaction could not be completed. Please use a different payment instrument." I was shocked. This kind of message was expected if you used a card or netbanking. But I wasn't. I was using Google Play balance to make my purchase. Needless to say, I waited a couple of days. But the problem persisted. I went to Google Support. Made a ticket in chat, and at the end of it, the representative says that "There is a temporary hold on your account. I will contact my specialist team and let them know. You will get a response within 24 hours." I thought, cool. I can wait one more day. But the next day, they send me a mail.<br><br>

        My heart skipped a beat. Then I thought, "this can't be that bad." Then I saw that I had to upload proof of my payment methods and a government issued ID. Now, if you have a little bit of IQ, you'd think, "wait, how do I prove I used google play balance?" That's exactly what I thought! So, I just screenshotted by gift card code, proof of purchase and the screenshot of my balance saying "Google Play Balance: 190.00" And I also uploaded my government ID.<br><br>

        Two days go by, and I am met with this.<br><br>

        Tell me, how am I supposed to react to this? You can see that guy signed "Sam". In a previous email to me, he said that "I will make sure your inconvinience is solved. You can count on me." What kind of counting on, my guy? Just because I made 2 or 3 purchases, you're gonna nuke my whole profile? Now, I cannot make a single purchase even if I wanted to. And I have decided to move on from Google altogether.<br><br>

        This is not the single time something like this has happened. One of my old accounts in 2016-17 was suffering a problem, wherein the YouTube player was not running, despite me having a great internet connection. I contacted Google, and I received NO response. Absolutely no response.<br><br>

        What am I supposed to do with this kind of support? This support is practically non-existent for me. So, I have decided to move on from Google, and switch to Microsoft. I have been replacing every aspect of my Google stuff with Microsoft and other products. Of course, to download apps, I'll need to use Google Play store. But, I have ditched my Gmail account in favor of a Google account setup with my Outlook mail. I have disabled vanilla YouTube, and I have downloaded <a href="https://revanced.app">YouTube Revanced</a>. Currently, all my Google needs have been met. Here's a quick rundown if anyone needs this:<br><br>
        ● G Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Keep Notes) --> Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote) [Free Web Versions]<br>
        ● Gmail --> Outlook<br>
        ● Calendar --> Outlook [If your phone doesn't have a stock calendar app]<br>
        ● Tasks --> Microsoft To-do<br>
        ● Chrome --> Edge, Brave, literally anything<br><br>

        These are the apps I currently use. If you need substitutes for other Google products, I'm sure you'll find them. My email "contact@bedanta.tech" was linked with Google SMTP. I will now need to route it with Outlook, I guess. Everything else is totally fine, and works the same, if not better.<br><br>

        Bottom line: Google, fuck you. Never in my million years would I think I'd say Microsoft is serving me better than you. But it is. Also, as for the rating you asked in your mail, you're in for a nice one.<br><br>
